# Multi-User-To-Do
## A Multi User To-do list developed using Django Framework and Python programming language.
* The main ideology of developing this multi-user to-do list is to engage multiple users using same to-do list rather than creating a single one for single person. In this project, multiple users can perform CRUD operations such as Login, Update, Signup, Delete and Logout.
