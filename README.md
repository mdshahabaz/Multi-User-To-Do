# Multi-User-To-Do List
## A Multi User To-do list developed using Django Framework and Python programming language.
* The main ideology of developing this multi-user to-do list is to engage multiple users using same to-do list rather than creating a single one for single person. In this project, multiple users can perform CRUD operations such as Login, Update, Signup, Delete and Logout.

# Login Page:
![Landing Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81280603/149076057-c8d1d44e-7d80-43df-9a4a-12b657b3d9b7.png)
* This is the Login Page or simply Landing Page when a new user opens it up.
  * In this login page, if the user is already registered (signed up), the user will be asked to provide credentials such as Username and Passowrd.
  * If the user has not registered yet, the user will be prompted to Signup page.

# Signup Page:

  * Username is kept unique for each user and hence, no duplication of username is allowed.
  * Password should contain combination of Upper letter, Lower letter, Special symbols, and numerals.

 * To perform updations such as changing the status of the todo task i.e., to change a task's status from pending to completed or vice versa, it is possible with ease by just clicking the action icons present. 
 * The status gets changed to desired one.
